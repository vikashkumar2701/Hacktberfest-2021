### API USAGE
```
FORMAT
http://profarm.ml/crop-api/<nitrogen>/<phosphorus>/<potassium>/<temperature>/<humidity>/<soilph>/<rainfall>/

RETURNS
Json Body with two fields 
1. crop_name (string)
2. accuracy (float)
```

### Local Deployment on Windows

1. Copy the `dfhmain` folder and `requirements.txt` file to a new folder.

2. Create a Virtual Environment in the folder using - 
```
pip install virtualenv

virtualenv dfhproject
```

3. Enter the Venv
```
dfhproject\Scripts\activate
```

3. Move to `dfhmain` and install required packages using -
```
cd dfhmain

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Perform migrations
```
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Run the Project
```
python manage.py runserver
```
